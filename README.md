# Dubai Property Analysis
This was an exploratory analysis using the data set found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataregress/dubai-properties-dataset/code

This was an introduction into the seaborn package as an alternative visualization tool compared to matplotlib.

The dataset had over 1,900 entries with various data types - integer, Boolean, string. 

Analysis included finding relationships between price and location, price and sqft, price and area. 
I also used seaborn and matplot to visualise these results.
